# Multi-function-face-recognition
This is a multi-function face recognition system. Our system combines the face recognition and retrieval capabilities of face_recognition with the extra capabilities of taking pictures and recording voice recordings. The system's usability and adaptability are greatly improved by this feature combination, making it a more useful tool for end users.
